<project name="go-ivy" default="install-ivy" xmlns:ivy="antlib:org.apache.ivy.ant">
	<!-- 
        this build file is a self contained project: it doesn't require anything else 
        that ant 1.6.2 or greater and java 1.4 or greater properly installed.
        
        It is used to showcase how easy and straightforward it can be to use Ivy.
        
        This is not an example of the best pratice to use in a project, especially
        for the java source code "generation" :-) (see generate-src target)
        
        To run copy this file in an empty directory, open a shell or a command window
        in this directory and run "ant". It will download ivy and then use it to resolve 
        the dependency of the class which is itself "contained" in this build script.
        
        After a successful build run "ant" again and you will see the build will be
        much faster.
        
        More information can be found at http://ant.apache.org/ivy/
