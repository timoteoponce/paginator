#Simple paginator component for Java

## Overview

After searching for a generic (without third-party dependencies) pagination component for several hours, 
I decided to start my own from scratch. After a few days I had a workable version of it: 
 - [Paginator site](http://timoteoponce.github.com/paginator/)

## Scope

Paginator is written to work with Java 1.5 and beyond, having no external dependencies with third-party 
libraries.
